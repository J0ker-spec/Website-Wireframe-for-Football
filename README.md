Football Hub Sierra Leone

Wireframe and Complete Website Build

This repository contains the wireframe and the full front end implementation for the Football Hub Sierra Leone website. The project shows how the agency’s content is structured, designed, and presented across five core pages: Home, Players, Matches, Contracts, and Contact.

The README focuses on clarity so anyone opening the repo understands what the project contains, how the layout works, and how to navigate the files.

Project Purpose

The project aims to
• show the planned structure of each page
• guide the front end layout before the backend is added
• give a clean starting point for future improvements such as filtering, player profiles, and match data integration

The wireframe and website code work together. The wireframe explains the layout. The website demonstrates the final look.

Pages Included

Each page follows an eight column grid based on the original plan.

• Home Page
Introduction, featured players, partner section, and quick navigation blocks.

Player grid with image placeholders. Structured for future filtering and profile expansion.
