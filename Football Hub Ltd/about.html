      <h2>About Football Hub</h2>

      <p>
        Football Hub started as a small idea in a living room where a group of
        fans argued about match results every weekend. The project grew into a
        full website designed to bring news, updates, statistics, and
        entertainment to football lovers.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        Our website highlights:
        <br />
        • Team news and league updates • Match schedules and live details •
        Player profiles and stats • Short stories about clubs and rising
        football talent
      </p>

      <p>
        Every article is written with simple language so both beginners and
        hardcore fans can follow along. Our team also keeps track of trending
        stories around African football, especially the Sierra Leone Premier
        League.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>

      <p>
        We want to make football information easy to find. Most websites are
        overloaded with ads, pop-ups, and complicated layouts. Football Hub
        focuses on clean presentation and quick access to what matters.

      <h3>Our Story</h3>

      <p>
        The website was originally built by a small two-person team. They used
        basic HTML files and simple styles before expanding it into a full hub.
        Over the years, the platform grew with input from fans who wanted a
        better way to track local teams.

        Some fun facts about our journey:
        <br />
        • The first article we posted had only 87 views. • Our “Top 5 Rising
        Stars” series blew up with over 12,000 reads. • The most requested
        feature was a player comparison tool, which we plan to add in the
        future.
      </p>

      <h3>Why We Built This</h3>

      <p>
        Football brings people together. Whether it's a heated derby or a quiet
        friendly match, fans want information they can trust. We built Football
        Hub to give every supporter a small home online.
